The Aparapi library is a neat way of migrating a CPU-intensive Java project to GPU to take advantage of its massive parallel processing prowess without rewriting the whole codebase. Sadly, the newest binaries available on the Aparapi project page is nearly 1.5 years old. There are lots of bugs in the old build, many of which are already fixed but the binaries are not updated.

After some trial and error I was able to check out the newest version of Aparapi code and compile it. To make the lives of other programmers simpler, I've decided to upload the package:

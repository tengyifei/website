It turns out that Wordpress.com is very restrictive over any advanced features e.g. CSS, Javascript. So I have to moving the host over to Heroku, which provides free cloud hosting solutions. The blog link will remain as [www.thinkingandcomputing.com](http://www.thinkingandcomputing.com "New address"). The original blog,Â tengyifei88.wordpress.com, will no longer be updated. Please navigate to the new address for future updates.

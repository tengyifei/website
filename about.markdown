Hi, I'm Yifei. I hope you enjoy using my esoteric creations or viewing my desultory ramblings.

I am currently a sophomore at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Passionate about programming and DIY spirits, I plan to make this blog a collection of my projects and ideas in computer science and electronic engineering. Occasionally I will post some music arrangements as well.

I believe the value of engineering lies not within theoretical constructs, but in its ability to solve pressing societal concerns. I wish to add an extra degree of "social awareness" to engineering in the future.

```java
public class Author extends Person {
    final String name = "Yifei Teng";
    final String nameChinese = "滕亦飞";
    String email = "tengyifei88 [ at ] gmail.com";
    String linkedin = "http://www.linkedin.com/in/yifeiteng";
    String facebook = "http://www.facebook.com/yifei.teng";
    String renren = "http://www.renren.com/259224995/profile";
    GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation().setCountry("China").setCity("Qingdao");
    Date birthdate = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy").parse("24-07-1995");
}
```
